283. Move Zeroes

Problem:
Given an integer array nums, move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

Note that you must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [0,1,0,3,12]
Output: [1,3,12,0,0]
Example 2:

Input: nums = [0]
Output: [0]

CONCEPT USED HERE IS TWO POINTER 

code:

class Solution(object):
    def moveZeroes(self, nums):
        count = 0
        n = len(nums)
        # bringing forward all non zero elements
        for i in range(n):
            if nums[i] != 0:
                nums[count] = nums[i]
                count += 1
        
        # now filling zeros in remaining positions left in array 
        while(count < n):
            nums[count] = 0
            count += 1

        return nums
