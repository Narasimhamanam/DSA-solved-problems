Second Largest Element in an Array

Given an array of positive integers arr[] of size n, the task is to find second largest distinct element in the array.
Note: If the second largest element does not exist, return -1.

Examples:
Input: arr[] = [12, 35, 1, 10, 34, 1]
Output: 34
Explanation: The largest element of the array is 35 and the second largest element is 34.

Input: arr[] = [10, 5, 10]
Output: 5
Explanation: The largest element of the array is 10 and the second largest element is 5.

Input: arr[] = [10, 10, 10]
Output: -1
Explanation: The largest element of the array is 10 there is no second largest element.

Two pointers concept (first and second)

code:

class Solution:
    def getSecondLargest(self, arr):
        # Code Here
        first = second = float('-inf')
        
        for i in arr:
            if i > first:
                second = first
                first = i
            elif i > second and i != first :
                second = i
            
        if second == float('-inf'):
            return -1
        else:
            return second
