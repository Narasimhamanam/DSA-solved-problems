You are given an integer array arr[]. You need to find the maximum sum of a subarray (containing at least one element) in the array arr[].

Note : A subarray is a continuous part of an array.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [2, 3, -8, 7, -1, 2, 3]
Output: 11
Explanation: The subarray [7, -1, 2, 3] has the largest sum 11.
Input: arr[] = [-2, -4]
Output: -2
Explanation: The subarray [-2] has the largest sum -2.
Input: arr[] = [5, 4, 1, 7, 8]
Output: 25
Explanation: The subarray [5, 4, 1, 7, 8] has the largest sum 25.

Code:

# Using Kadane's Algorithm

class Solution:
    def maxSubarraySum(self, arr):
        # Code here
        res = arr[0]
        maxEnding = arr[0]
        
        for i in range(1,len(arr)):
            # Find the maximum sum ending at index i by either extending
            # the maximum sum subarray ending at index i - 1 or by 
            # the starting a new subarray from index i
            
            maxEnding = max(maxEnding + arr[i],arr[i])
            
            # update res if maximum subarray sum ending at index i > res
            res = max(res,maxEnding)
        
        return res
